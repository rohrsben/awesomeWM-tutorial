        <h1>Getting Started</h1>

        <p>
            To start us off, I have provided a very pared-down rc.lua and theme folder. From this (barely functional) base, we will build towards a usable and customized awesomeWM setup, learning as we go.
        </p>

        <p>
            I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/gmdfalk/awmtt">awmtt</a> throughout the process, as it will make your life a whole lot easier. To set everything up, copy the contents of the starting-config folder into your .config/awesome folder. awmtt should start up using the provided rc.lua.test by default.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using awmtt is pretty simple - just type <code class="one_off">awmtt start</code> in a terminal. If the default window size is too small, add an <code class="one_off">-S</code> option (that's a capital S): something like <code class="one_off">awmtt start -S 1920x1080</code>. Once the window is open, press <code class="one_off">CTRL+Shift</code> to focus mouse and keyboard input (so you don't wreak havoc on your main desktop while testing things). Pressing <code class="one_off">CTRL+Shift</code> again will release focus.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to reload awesome with the changes you've made to rc.lua.test, close awmtt with <code class="one_off">awmtt stop</code> and then rerun the start command you used previously. Don't worry, you won't have to do this for long.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once everything is up and running, you should be greeted with a window that looks like this: 
        </p>

        <img src="pics/tutorial-background.png" alt="It'll get better" width="600">

        <p>
            You can't do anything with it yet, because of how stripped down the functionality is, but that's where the "get better" part comes in. So, let's get started!
